            - Midday operations remain relatively stable.
            - Station 11 shows a significantly higher kickout rate (~32% vs. ~22%), suggesting a local issue.

            - Stop probability remains low at normal speeds but increases sharply beyond ~2.3 m/s.
            - Higher speeds significantly increase the risk of system instability and should be avoided.
